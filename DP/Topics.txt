Knapsack Pattern..................................
Subset sum
Equal sum partition
Count of subset sum with a given sum
Minimum subset Sum difference
Count the number of subset with a given diff
Target Sum

Unbounded Knapsack................................
Rod Cutting
Coin change maximum
coin change minimum

///Longest Common subsequence.........................
///longest common substring
print longest common subsequence
////shortest common super sequence
minimum number of insert and delete to 
longest palandromic subsequence
min no of delete in a string to make
print shortest common supersequence
longest repeating subsequence
sequence pattern matching
minimun number of insertion

matrix chain multipication.........................
